# avatar-maker-app

In this repository, I use Streamlit share to deploy an app built on streamlit. The app is used to create an avatar image.

The app creates an avatar based on the users' choices of the options provided. Changes to the avatar can be viewed before downloading the final image.

The deployed web app is live at https://stan-leigh-avatar-maker-app-avatar-app-4f6sov.streamlit.app/
